Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Nikita,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in a loving galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in December. There are 5 cucumbers and sweet potatoes of basketball here! In the
[10] there is a pool full of water. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for
3000 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a blue car!!

Best wishes,
Daniel
