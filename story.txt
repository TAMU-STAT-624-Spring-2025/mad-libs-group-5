Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Nikita,

I am writing to you from a funny spaceship in a loving galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in December. There are 21 carrots and onions of ladder here! In the locker room there is a pool full of lemonade. I fall asleep each night on a brave bed of
concrete and dream of running quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
3000 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a blue car!!

Best wishes,
Daniel
